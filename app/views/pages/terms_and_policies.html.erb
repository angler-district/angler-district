    <h3>1. Angler District is a Venue</h3>
    <p>
      Angler District acts as a venue to allow users who comply with Angler District's policies to offer, sell and buy certain goods within a fixed-price format. Angler District is not directly involved in the transaction between buyers and sellers. As a result, Angler District has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the items listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items. Angler District does not pre-screen users or the content or information provided by users. Angler District cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction.
      Consequently, Angler District does not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer.
      Angler District cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a user. Angler District encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on the Site.

    <h3>3. Fees and Services</h3>
    <p>
      Joining and setting up a shop on Angler District is free. Angler District does not charge fees to list an item for sale. Angler District does charge a percentage of the sale price when the item sells. When you list an item you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Angler District's Fees Policy, which is subject to change, is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Changes to the Fees Policy and the fees for Angler District's services are effective after Angler District provides you with at least fourteen (14) days' notice by posting the changes on the Site. However, Angler District may choose to temporarily change the Fees Policy and the fees for Angler District's services for promotional events (for example, free listing days); such changes are effective when Angler District posts the temporary promotional event on the Site. Angler District may, at Angler District's sole discretion, change some or all of Angler District's services at any time. In the event Angler District introduces a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in US Dollars (USD). Fees will include final sale price of an item as well as shipping fees on an order.
      In certain situations, including but not limited to a void or invalid transaction and returns, Angler District may issue a credit for the applicable fees to a seller's billing statement.
      You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with using Angler District. Angler District allows sellers to indicate applicable tax jurisdictions which will be collected from buyers through Angler District at point of sale.  Angler District keeps accepted payment information on file. At the beginning of the month, each seller is emailed an invoice detailing the amount due. A seller must pay the amount due in full within 15 days of the date of the invoice.
      Fees and Termination: If Angler District terminates a listing or your account, if you close your account, or if the payment of your Angler District fees cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay Angler District for all unpaid fees plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is not paid in full and becomes past due, the seller risks penalties such as the suspension of privileges and/or termination of the account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining collection agencies and legal counsel).

      By listing an item on the Site you warrant that you and all aspects of the item comply with Angler District's published policies. You also warrant that you may legally sell the item. You must accurately describe your item and all terms of sale in your Angler District shop. Your listings may only include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other content relevant to the sale of that item supplied by yourself.

The inclusion of phone numbers or email addresses directly in listings, shop banners, or shop policies is prohibited. All items must be listed in an appropriate category with appropriate tags. Each listing must accurately and completely describe the item/items for sale in that listing. If the "in stock" quantity is more than one, all items in that listing must be identical. Each unique item must have its own listing.

Sellers must create reasonable policies in good faith and must abide by such policies. All shop policies must comply with Angler District's site-wide policies. Sellers are responsible for enforcing their own reasonable shop policies. Angler District reserves the right to request that a seller modify a shop policy.
      Binding Sale: All sales are binding. The seller is obligated to ship the order or otherwise complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the buyer fails to meet the terms of the seller's listing (such as payment method), or (b) the seller cannot authenticate the buyer's identity. The buyer is obligated to deliver appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance.  By purchasing an item on Angler District, the buyer agrees to the specific return and other policies set forth by the individual seller.
      Fee Avoidance: The price stated in each item listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may charge reasonable shipping and handling fees to cover the costs for packaging and mailing the items. Sellers may not charge excessive shipping fees.
